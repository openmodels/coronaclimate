This directory contains two sets of simple model experiments, to build intuition.

 - `detection.R` simulates an SIR model and then adjusts the detection
   rate. The apparent growth rate in infected cases is then computed,
   to understand how changes in detection affect this.
   
 - `sir.R` includes multiple SIR and SEIR models, and in each case
   increases the transmission rate in one period in order to look at
   the resulting impulse responses.
