Replication code for studying the association between weather and COVID-19

The code is organized into three directories:
 - `panel-regression`: This includes step-by-step replication code for performing the regression analysis and evaluating the results.
 - `seir-model`: This includes code for fitting the Bayesian SEIR model and interpretting the results.
 - `simple`: This includes a couple of simple SIR/SEIR simulations, to understand features of the response.
 
 Additional README files are included in these directories. The code relies on data in the following Zenodo repository: https://zenodo.org/record/7262562
